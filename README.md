# Production Quantity Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project aims to predict future production quantities based on historical data using machine learning algorithms. The script retrieves production and delivery data from a SQL Server database, preprocesses the data, builds predictive models, and generates forecasts for future dates.

## Dependencies
- pyodbc
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- cryptography

## Instructions
1. Configure the SQL Server connection details in the script.
2. Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed.
3. Run the Python script to perform data analysis and generate predictions.
4. Interpret the results and analyze the CSV files generated by the script.

## File Structure
- `production_quantity_prediction.py`: Main Python script for data analysis and prediction.
- `result_Linear_Regression.csv`: Predictions generated by the Linear Regression model.
- `result_Decision_Tree.csv`: Predictions generated by the Decision Tree model.
- `result_Gradient_Boosting.csv`: Predictions generated by the Gradient Boosting model.
- `result_Random_Forest.csv`: Predictions generated by the Random Forest model.
- `consolidated_result.csv`: Consolidated results from all models.
